ARTICLE: Problem Statement Development: How to Write a Problem Statement in A Dissertation
D. Anthony Miles
2019

Abstract

Most researchers and doctoral students have considerable trouble writing a problem statement with their research projects dissertations, and theses. We have to ask ourselves, why that is? Why are we encountering doctoral students and researchers that have trouble writing the problem statement? Why the disconnect? This is a common occurrence with doctoral students. We would think the required research methods course would address this. However, that is not case. Thus, this article addresses, discusses and illustrates how to develop a problem statement. This article will provide a model and template for developing a problem statement. As basis for a research study, it is important the researcher and doctoral student know how to construct a problem statement. First, this article discusses the problem statement. Second, this article provides a model as a for developing a problem statement. Last, the article provides examples of problem statements using the conceptual template.

ARTICLE: " Let’s Stop the Madness Part 3: Understanding the Difference Between Contributions of the Study vs. Significance of the Study”
2019 •D. Anthony Miles
The purpose of this article is to provide some clear distinctions and insight on the differences between the contributions of the study and the significance of the study. This is a common confusion between the two terms and is even more confusing explaining them in the study. There is a tendency to use the terms synonymously. I see this confusion at a prevalent level with both novice and experienced researchers. Thus, this article tries to provide some clear understanding of the two terms and provides some clear definitions and examples of them both. This article provides some practical importance to researchers in social sciences. This article provides some valuable knowledge and give the researcher guidance using the correct use of these two terms. The objective of this article is threefold. First, the article provides some clear definitions on contributions of the study and significance of the study. Second, this article provides clear examples of the differences and characteristics between the two terms. Last, this article provides examples from articles and studies using of the two terms. This article will provide much needed clarity to many researchers that are confused by the two terms and how to use them in the proper context.

The Qualitative Report
David Blum
Grade inflation is a problem at universities in the United States. To understand the cultural effect of grade inflation at a regionally accredited online university in the United States, I conducted autoethnographic research as a participant and observer. In this autoethnographic study, the purpose of my research was to explore my experiences being immersed in a grade inflation culture. I addressed a gap of autoethnographic research related to a culture of grade inflation existing at an online university in the United States. I provided seven themes serving as my discoveries related to my observations and participation as a faculty member. My discoveries supported my assumptions that a culture of grade inflation likely exists at the online university. My discoveries also contribute to the overriding theme in the extant literature that grade inflation exists. My discoveries also support the concept that grade inflation is not limited to on ground universities but also extends to online universities in the United States.

Earning a doctorate degree is one of the highest honors in one&#39;s journey of academic progress; yet very few candidates actually achieve this rank. Part of the reason for some of the challenges in achieving such a rank can be the time requirement, the rigorous and focused research process, passing the comprehensive examinations, a publication requirement, and successfully finishing the

Educators' Perceptions of Bullying Before and After Implementing a Bullying Prevention Program
Lorraine D Phillips
Abstract In suburban schools in Western Pennsylvania, students, educators, parents, and community members are experiencing the negative effects caused by school bullying. Some educators cannot identify bullying, do not perceive bullying as problematic, or are not trained to intervene in bullying events. The purpose of this quasi-experimental, single group, pretest/posttest design study was to determine if implementing a bullying prevention program significantly changed educators’ perceptions of bullying. James’s theory of self-perception provided the framework for this study to determine educators’ behaviors toward bullying. Sixty presurveys and 50 postsurveys (Bully Index Scale) were completed by educators on SurveyMonkey.com. Data were entered into SPSS and a MANCOVA was performed. According to study results, there was a change in how educators perceived bullying after training and implementation of the bullying prevention program. Data analysis was used to disclose significant changes in educators’ perceptions overall and between male and female educators, altering perceptions may influence positive behavioral changes. Recommendations following this study include sharing findings with the district and bullying committees and continued staff training. Educators have an obligation to understand their perceptions of bullying before interacting with students and intervening in bullying events. Therefore, a positive social change would include self-assessment and bullying prevention training for all school district employees and preservice teachers.
